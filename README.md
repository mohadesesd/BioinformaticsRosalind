# Bioinformatics Algorithms in Python

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python solutions for two classic problems in bioinformatics: "Semiglobal Alignment" and "Longest Multiple Repeat". These solutions are crafted to pass the test cases provided by the Rosalind platform, a popular resource for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem-solving.

## Algorithms

1. **Semiglobal Alignment**: This algorithm aligns two sequences by considering end gaps free in one sequence. It's a hybrid between global and local alignment, often used when aligning sequences of slightly different lengths.

2. **Longest Multiple Repeat**: This algorithm finds the longest repeated substring that appears more than once in a DNA sequence. It is useful for identifying repeat structures in genomic DNA.
